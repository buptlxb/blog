Now, the VOA Special English program -- words and their stories.

Today, I will tell about expressions using numbers. Let us start with the number one.

Numbers can be tricky. **one the one hand**, they are simply numbers. On the other hand, they have meanings.
I **for one** using these expressions a lot.

Many people consider themselves **number one** -- the most important person. They are always **looking out for number one**
and **taking care of number one**.
It is as if they are the **one and only** person on Earth.  
Some people, however, are not so self-centered.
My brother is such a person.
It is true -- no joke!
I am not trying to **pull a fast one** on you.

First, you have to understand that my brother is **one in a million**.
He is such a nice person. All his friends like him.
They consider him **one of the boys**.
Recently, my brother has a bad day in the office.
It was just **one of those days**. Nothing went right.
So he stopped at a local bar -- a drinking place -- after leaving work.
My brother plans to have a glass of beer with his friends -- **a quick one** -- before he went home.
But **a quick one** turned into **one or two**, and soon those became **one too many**.

As my brother wasing leaving, he ordered a last drink -- **one for the road**.
His friends became concerned.
**One by one**, they ask him if he was able to drive home safely.

Now, my brother is a wise and calm person.
He is **at one with himeself**.
He recognizes when he has had too much alcohol to drink.
So, he accepted a offer for a ride home from a female friend.

**At one time** in the past, my brother had been in love with this woman.
She is a great person -- kind, thoughtful and intelligent -- all good qualities **rolled up into one**.
But, sadly their relationship did not work.
He always used to say "**One of these days**, I am going to marry with this girl."
But, that never happened.

**For one thing**, she did not love him as muck as he loved her.
It was just **one of those things**.
The situtation was regrettable and my brother had to accept it.
But, even now, he considers her **the one that got away**.

However, they are still friends.
And because my brother had been kind to her, she felt that **one good turn deserves another**.
He was good to her and she wanted to help him in return.
So, she drove him home.

If my brother had driven home from the bar that night, **his number would have been up**.
Something bad would have happened.
Thankfully, he made it home safely.
And he and the woman was **back to square one**.
They are back to where they started -- being friends.
