&lt;p&gt;Today, I will tell about expressions using numbers. Let us start with the number one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numbers can be tricky. &lt;strong&gt;one the one hand&lt;/strong&gt;, they are simply numbers. On the other hand, they have meanings.
I &lt;strong&gt;for one&lt;/strong&gt; using these expressions a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people consider themselves &lt;strong&gt;number one&lt;/strong&gt; -- the most important person. They are always &lt;strong&gt;looking out for number one&lt;/strong&gt;
and &lt;strong&gt;taking care of number one&lt;/strong&gt;.
It is as if they are the &lt;strong&gt;one and only&lt;/strong&gt; person on Earth.&lt;br /&gt;
Some people, however, are not so self-centered.
My brother is such a person.
It is true -- no joke!
I am not trying to &lt;strong&gt;pull a fast one&lt;/strong&gt; on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you have to understand that my brother is &lt;strong&gt;one in a million&lt;/strong&gt;.
He is such a nice person. All his friends like him.
They consider him &lt;strong&gt;one of the boys&lt;/strong&gt;.
Recently, my brother has a bad day in the office.
It was just &lt;strong&gt;one of those days&lt;/strong&gt;. Nothing went right.
So he stopped at a local bar -- a drinking place -- after leaving work.
My brother plans to have a glass of beer with his friends -- &lt;strong&gt;a quick one&lt;/strong&gt; -- before he went home.
But &lt;strong&gt;a quick one&lt;/strong&gt; turned into &lt;strong&gt;one or two&lt;/strong&gt;, and soon those became &lt;strong&gt;one too many&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my brother wasing leaving, he ordered a last drink -- &lt;strong&gt;one for the road&lt;/strong&gt;.
His friends became concerned.
&lt;strong&gt;One by one&lt;/strong&gt;, they ask him if he was able to drive home safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, my brother is a wise and calm person.
He is &lt;strong&gt;at one with himeself&lt;/strong&gt;.
He recognizes when he has had too much alcohol to drink.
So, he accepted a offer for a ride home from a female friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At one time&lt;/strong&gt; in the past, my brother had been in love with this woman.
She is a great person -- kind, thoughtful and intelligent -- all good qualities &lt;strong&gt;rolled up into one&lt;/strong&gt;.
But, sadly their relationship did not work.
He always used to say "&lt;strong&gt;One of these days&lt;/strong&gt;, I am going to marry with this girl."
But, that never happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For one thing&lt;/strong&gt;, she did not love him as muck as he loved her.
It was just &lt;strong&gt;one of those things&lt;/strong&gt;.
The situtation was regrettable and my brother had to accept it.
But, even now, he considers her &lt;strong&gt;the one that got away&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, they are still friends.
And because my brother had been kind to her, she felt that &lt;strong&gt;one good turn deserves another&lt;/strong&gt;.
He was good to her and she wanted to help him in return.
So, she drove him home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my brother had driven home from the bar that night, &lt;strong&gt;his number would have been up&lt;/strong&gt;.
Something bad would have happened.
Thankfully, he made it home safely.
And he and the woman was &lt;strong&gt;back to square one&lt;/strong&gt;.
They are back to where they started -- being friends.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="VOA Special English"></category></entry><entry><title>Worlds 2015-05-19</title><link href="http://www.gotit.sinaapp.com/worlds-2015-05-19.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-05-19T20:47:39+08:00</updated><author><name>ictlxb</name></author><id>tag:www.gotit.sinaapp.com,2015-05-19:worlds-2015-05-19.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;oust&lt;/h2&gt;
